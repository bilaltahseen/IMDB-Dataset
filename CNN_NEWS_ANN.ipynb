      "Enter NewsAnd that behaviour seems ... let me find the word ... wrong. Yes, wrong is the word. Wrong. Utterly objectionable. Objectionable works, because sensible prime ministers know that in times of national emergency, you show. You don’t tell, at least not with a crude bit of agitprop on the Liberal party website and pumped out on platforms. You show. Show up, first of all, and you show leadership by actually leading. Not by telling people you are leading. Otherwise you are not a leader. You are an internet meme. Dear Mr Morrison. You are the prime minister, not the Liberal party spruiker. We really do need you to understand that difference.  PM tries to present himself as a leader reborn – but you just can’t take the marketing out of Scotty David Marr David Marr  Read more Now of course governments need to tell citizens what they are doing, and perhaps the argument for doing this increases when there has been a rapid recalibration from the top like the one we’ve seen over the past week or so.  But Tropical Beats was not an essential communication. Not on Saturday. I doubt it was an essential communication on any day quite frankly, but certainly not on Saturday.  On Saturday, people in extremis, in fire zones, needed to know where to be or where not to be. They needed to know where exactly the danger was and how to avoid it.  They did not need a prime minister in their face on social platforms shouting “I have not screwed this up. I am taking command of this situation. I have All The Things and I’m Deploying Them.”  Not on a day where authorities were dealing with life and death.  Not on that day.  Since you're here... … we have a small favour to ask. More people, like you, are reading and supporting the Guardian’s independent, investigative journalism than ever before. And unlike many news organisations, we made the choice to keep our reporting open for all, regardless of where they live or what they can afford to pay.  The Guardian will engage with the most critical issues of our time – from the escalating climate catastrophe to widespread inequality to the influence of big tech on our lives. At a time when factual information is a necessity, we believe that each of us, around the world, deserves access to accurate reporting with integrity at its heart.  Our editorial independence means we set our own agenda and voice our own opinions. Guardian journalism is free from commercial and political bias and not influenced by billionaire owners or shareholders. This means we can give a voice to those less heard, explore where others turn away, and rigorously challenge those in power.  We hope you will consider supporting us today. We need your support to keep delivering quality journalism that’s open and independent. Every reader contribution, however big or small, is so valuable. Support The Guardian from as little as £1 – and it only takes a minute. Thank you.\n"
